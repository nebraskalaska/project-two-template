This spec site was created to show the ideal layout and functionality of a potential redesign for the Disjecta Community Arts Center webiste. As a result only the top two links on the menu are clickable, as well as the first entry on the calendar page. 

User Path For Spec Site:
Splash Page (index.html) > Home Page > Location + Contact > Calendar Page > Portland2019 Biennial (First Calendar Entry)
